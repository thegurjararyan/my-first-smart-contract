# My First Smart Contract

Welcome to the "My First Smart Contract" project! This repository documents my journey in creating and deploying my very first Ethereum smart contract by following the Web3 University guide on creating smart contracts. You can access the original guide here: [Web3 University Smart Contract Guide](https://www.web3.university/tracks/create-a-smart-contract/deploy-your-first-smart-contract).
