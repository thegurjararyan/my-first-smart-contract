# My First Smart Contract

Welcome to the "My First Smart Contract" project! This repository documents my journey in creating and deploying my very first Ethereum smart contract by following the Web3 University guide on creating smart contracts. You can access the original guide here: [Web3 University Smart Contract Guide](https://www.web3.university/tracks/create-a-smart-contract/deploy-your-first-smart-contract).

## Smart Contract Verification

My smart contract is deployed on the Goerli testnet. You can verify it on Etherscan using the following link:
